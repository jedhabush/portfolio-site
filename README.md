# Portfolio-Website

### Description of project:
The porfolio was built during the _Nology bootcamp. I was given the task to build my own portfolio site. I was asked to utilize what I learnt during the training. However, I decided to take it to another level. Besides utilizing what I learnt during the course I wanted to do something more meaningful, something that I can be very proud of. I decided to learn new skills while creating the portfolio. It was a good opportunity to expand my knowledge in Javascript and SCSS. I was not doing the porfolio to just meet the requirement but to showcase what I'm capable of. 

### Future goals
At some point in the future, I plan to re-design the portfolio using ReactJs. The reason to use ReactJs is due to it's scalability, ReactJs is faster than plain HTML whcih leads to faster response time, easier to maintain due to it's component reusability and most importantly, it makes JS coding faster and easier. 

### Tech Stack
1- Javascript <br/>
2- HTML <br/>
3- SCSS <br/>
4- SCSS Animations <br/>
5- Multiple devices responsiveness
