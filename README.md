# Portfolio-Website

### Description of project:
The porfolio was built during the _Nology bootcamp. I was given the task to build my own portfolio site. I was asked to utilize what I learnt during the training. However, I decided to take it to another level. Besides utilizing what I learnt during the course I wanted to do something more meaningful, something that I can be very proud of. I decided to learn new skills while creating the portfolio. It was a good opportunity to expand my knowledge in Javascript and SCSS. I was not doing the porfolio just meet the requirement but to showcase what I'm capable of. 

### Future goals
At some point in the future, I plan to re-design the portfolio using ReactJs. The reason to use ReactJs is due to it's scalability, ReactJs is faster than plain HTML which leads to faster response time (rendering), easier to maintain due to it's component reusability and most importantly, it makes JS coding faster and easier. 

### Challenges
- The first time I was introduced to SCSS was during the bootcamp. It took a bit of time to wrap my head around SCSS functions and mixins but as soon as I understood the concept it was an instant love. I tried to use SCSS functions and mixins as much as possible in my portfolio site. It was a great introduction to code in blocks and not to repeat yourself if you don't have to.
- Animation can be very tricky if you don't understand how the pieces work together. I tried to expose myself to a wide range of animation styles. Although, I think my portfolio might be a bit over-animated but I still like the idea of making static design more interactive and appealing to the eye.
- DOM manipulation can be challenging if you don't understand how to design your HTML properly. I had to re-design my HTML multiple times to avoid CSS and style overlapping.
- Colour matching. The concept of colour matching and colour blending is underrated in my opinion. Colours can make or break any website. I spent hours trying tons of differnt colours to ensure the website is appealing to the eye and not too noisy. Before finalizing the colour set, I asked the internet opinion about the selected colours set, I also asked friends and family if they like the colours and if they have any suggestions on how to improve it.
